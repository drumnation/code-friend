# CODE-FRIEND!
The Ultimate Pairing Tool for the Meticulous Flatiron Student

![](https://github.com/drumnation/learn-live-love/blob/master/code-friend-demo.gif)

This MVP helps students from Flatiron Class 031317 organize pair programming groups.
Students can login by choosing their name from a menu and enter a lab url to check which students haven't completed that lab yet.  

A list is returned and the organizer is given the option to text all the students on the list.  If you decide to text your group the organizer can set a location and a time within an hour from the current time.
